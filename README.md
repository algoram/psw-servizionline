# Polimi Online Services Password Generator

Simple script to generate passwords for the Politecnico di Milano Servizi Online

To run simply use:

```python
python main.py
```

I haven't searched online for a safe random function and just picked the first one that suited me (in this case `random.shuffle()`), feel free to change it if you need better security
